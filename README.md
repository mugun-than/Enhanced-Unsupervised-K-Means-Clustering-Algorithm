# Enhanced-unsupervised-k-means-clustering-algorithm
## Overview
An enhanced unsupervised k means clustering algorithm. The basic idea is to improve the performance unsupervised k means clustering algorithm available from the research paper by Kristina P Sinaga at IEEE. 
## Approaches
- Increasing the efficiency of algorithm by implementing a different distance metrics rather than usually used euclidean distance metric by reducing the computational complexity.
- Reducing the time complexity by storing the necessary information in an array so that the algorithm need not to restart itself in each iterations.
