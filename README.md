# Enhanced-unsupervised-k-means-clustering-algorithm
## Overview
An enhanced unsupervised k means clustering algorithm. The basic idea is to improve the performance of unsupervised k means clustering algorithm available from the research paper titled "Unsupevised K Means Clustering Algorithm" by Kristina P Sinaga and Miin Shen Yang at IEEE Access. 
## Approaches
- Increasing the efficiency of algorithm by implementing a different distance metrics replacing the usually used euclidean distance metric which in turn reduces the computational complexity.
- Reducing the time complexity by implementing a data structure to keep some necessary information in each iteration to be used in the next iteration, so that the algorithm itself doesn't gets restarted in each iteration.
